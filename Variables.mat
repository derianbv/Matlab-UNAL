%{ Here we store values for variables in Matlab  

All variable are array, a single number is just a variable [1,1] or escalar
this means that all variables are vectors

to make a row vector x =[1,2] pueden estar separados por espacio o no
to make a column vector x =[1;2]
combine: x = [3 4 5;6 7 8] inside these vectors you can make operations
x = 
    3    4    5
    6    7    8
